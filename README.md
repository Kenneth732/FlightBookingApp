Flight Search and Display Web App

This repository contains a Flight Search and Display web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app allows users to search for available flights based on their origin, destination, and desired departure date. It provides a user-friendly interface to view the available flights that match the search criteria.

Key Features:

- **Search Flights:** Users can enter their desired origin, destination, and departure date in the search form to find available flights.

- **Display Flight Results:** The app displays a list of flights that match the search criteria, including origin, destination, departure date, airline, price, and available seats.

- **Booking Simulation:** While the app does not handle actual flight bookings, it simulates the booking process when users click the "Book Now" button associated with each flight.

- **Sample Flight Data:** For demonstration purposes, the app includes sample flight data that is locally stored. However, in a production environment, this data would typically be fetched from a remote API.

Usage:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to access the Flight Search and Display web app.

3. Enter the origin, destination, and departure date in the search form to find available flights.

4. View the search results, including flight details, and click the "Book Now" button to simulate a flight booking.

Please note that this web app is intended for demonstration and learning purposes. In a real-world scenario, it would be integrated with a backend server and a flight booking API to handle actual flight bookings and provide live flight data.

Enjoy exploring and learning from this Flight Search and Display web app!
